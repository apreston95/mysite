QuantEcon began as a [website](http://www.quant-econ.net) developed by Tom Sargent and John Stachurski oriented around teaching quantitative economic modeling. As time has passed the project has broadened its scope to, not only teaching, but developing open source computational tools for economics, econometrics, and decision making. The project is currently funded by the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](http://www.sloan.org/) and has non-profit status by being a [NUMFOCUS](http://www.numfocus.org/) fiscally sponsored project. QuantEcon is currently guided by a steering committee which consists of: Susan Athey, Daisuke Oyama, Matthew McKay, John Stachurski, and Thomas Sargent.
