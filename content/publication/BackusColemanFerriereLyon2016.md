abstract = "In models with recursive preferences, endogenous variation in Pareto weights would be interpreted as wedges from the perspective of a frictionless model with additive preferences. We describe the behavior of the relative Pareto weight in a two-country world and explore its interaction with consumption and the real exchange rate."
